# FoodHub Data Analysis

## Introduction
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Many students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favourite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after the restaurant confirms it. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin on the delivery order from the restaurants.
## Objective of this analysis
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the orders the registered customers made in their online portal. The aim of this analysis is to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience.
