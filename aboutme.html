I am a Data entry/Customer Service officer with over 3 years’ experience in data entry, customer satisfaction and retention. Passionate about customer service, I have built a track record for exceeding customer expectations on a consistent basis. 

I got into customer service because of my passion for helping people and solving their problems. Having started out as a Data Entry officer, I have since progressed to the role of Account Maintenance Officer. 

I am currently employed at Whytecleon Limited (seconded to First Bank Of Nigeria). In this role, I oversee the delivery of excellent customer service while managing a team of eight. 

My accomplishments during time in this role include:
- Resolved over 150 customer requests daily and reduced the overall Turn Around Time.
- Contributed to the team’s Customer Satisfaction rating increase of 55% due to quality checks in customer data entry into the core banking database.
- Peered with the Anti-fraud team to reduce fraud cases by designing control systems to reduce errors in customer data entry; fraud cases reduced by 20%. 

When I’m not working in customer service, I enjoy working with data; data cleaning and analysis using Microsoft Excel and SQL, data visualization using Tableau and Microsoft PowerBI. 

Specialty:
Customer Service, Customer Satisfaction, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, Communication, Data Entry, Analyst, Administrative Assistant.
